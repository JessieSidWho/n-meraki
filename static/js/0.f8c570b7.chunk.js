Currently, I am traveling the country and living on the East Coast. Generally, I connect with clientel via word of mouth, but because I love what I do I am looking to expand my business. I decided to start Nara Meraki because, to be honest, clutter and disorganized homes drive me bananas! I have always helped friends and family replace, reorganize and declutter their homes. My work involves completely transforming rooms; from mounting TV\u2019s, rearranging furniture, replacing artwork, etc. Over time, organizing and decluttering became my favorite hobby, so I decided to start this business and put my skills to use.","section":[{"title":"The Origin of Nara Meraki","content":"This company is named after my hero, who is also my mother, Nara.

On weekdays, prior to my sister and I leaving for school I remember her always saying, \u201cIf you have anything on the floors, pick it up now or I will toss it before you get home!\u201d And she was serious, she once even threw away all my favorite barbie dolls.","icon":""},{"title":"","content":"Yes, my mom was strict about keeping things neat, but that helped mold me into the woman I am today. My mom was truly an amazing mother. She was a fantastic cook, and she was my biggest fan when I was a cheerleader and never missed an event. She always put mine and my siblings needs in front of hers. Unfortunately, her time on earth was short lived, but I am grateful for the 17 years of my life I got to spend with this incredible woman. She made me the person I have become, and it is an honor to name my company after her."}]}')},134:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Services","text":""}')},135:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Projects","text":""}')},136:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Contact Me","text":"Please reach out for any questions, booking info/availability, or inquires.
